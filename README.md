## Project Info
Utilizing Instagram's user data download feature, this utility serves to show you all of the people that did not reciprocate your follow and vice-versa. Unlike many other web based solutions to this problem, this program can handle large data sets of follower/following user data, and does not have to rely on Instagram's annoying rate limits.

Additionally, since this application is locally operated, the risk of your Instagram account being flagged as a bot or rate-limited is fully mitigated.
